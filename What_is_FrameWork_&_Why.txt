What is Frame Work and why?

A framework, or software framework, is a platform that provides a foundation for developing software applications. 
Think of it as a template of a working program that can be selectively modified by adding code. 
It uses shared resources – such as libraries, image files, and reference documents – and puts them together in one package. 
That package can be modified to suit the specific needs of the project. 
With a framework, the developer can add or replace features to give new functionality to the application.
