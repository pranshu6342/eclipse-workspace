Maven Project--->

Maven is basically a project management tool, where we manage our projects, 
we can  build projects, deploy projects & many more features like reporting & documentation. 
It refers concept of Project Object Model (POM). In a short term, it is a build tool.

If you are using build tool like mavn, it simplifies your build process. 
everything becomes very simple because it follows some life-cycle what it has. 
we will talk about mavn life-cycle in couple of next para.

Why do we need maven project?


Earlier project who does not have mavn, they need to add jar files manually & if multiple persons are working on the same project, 
they have to use same jar files. If one has changed, it cause issues. 
Also earlier to mavn, we used to create project folder structure by our own. 
Where as after mavn, this is not manually required, because â€“

1. In case of maven project, you need not add any jar files in to the project. just add all your dependency in POM.xml file
2. Maven project creates a very good project folder structure for coding purpose.

So, in Short, Maven has two main purposes
Project management (Includes creating folder structure, compiling, packaging etc.)
Dependency management (update dependencies in POM.xml file to download jar automatically)


What is POM.xml?
POM is an xml file that contain an information about project and configuration details used by maven to build project.
 Information is about name, version, artifact it, dependencies, plugin information & profiles.
 We will talk about POM.xml in more details in coming sessions.
